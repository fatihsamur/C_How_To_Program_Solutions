# C_How_To_Program_Solutions
Solutions of problems from the Deitel's "C How To Program" book 8.th edition.
It includes solutions of 3-6 chapters. All files named according to the chapter number and question number. 

I prepared these solutions long time ago so the codes needs to be tested and refactored. But still some of them may help people who try to learn C programming by Deitel's book.
